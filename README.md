# bachelors_project

npz_files are files from https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/WiFi_CSI_dataset_for_device-to-device_localization/20943706 converted to numpy z files for easier handling.

read_csi_classification.py can read the data from the other github page

distance.py is trying to calculate distance from the npz files

ai_distance.py is an ai model trained on the npz files. not intended to be actually used in project but more a verification that the data wasn't complete garbage.
